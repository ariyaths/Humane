# Humane

## Being logical, rational, scientific while also humane? 

### Albert Schweitzer: "Humanitarianism consists in never sacrificing a human being to a purpose."

### for example
* An unborn child with high chance of mental retardation. Abort?
* A child born with severe disabilities, eg. blind, or deaf, or with permanent mental retardation like Down's Syndrome or Fragile X.
* A newly married couple, one of them soon realizes that the other has severe mental issues. Should he/she stand by their vow and accept lifelong role of caretaker, or divorce?
* A firm realises that a newly hired employee has many medical issues and falls sick often. Terminate the employment?
* All humans become old and senile, some also bankrupt and sick with requirement of costly Medicare. 

For all the above examples religion easily let's us choose the human, and accept the sacrifice. Since all sacrifices in a religious context are meritorious.
But, for a logical, rational, scientific person, what is the humane decision? The sacrifices won't improve the situation; neither for the patient nor the caregiver.


#### Is euthanasia denied on humanitarian grounds, or, on rational grounds?  
* Passive Euthanatia "Pulling the Plug"
* Active Euthanatia "a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering"
  * expressed by whom?
  * intractable!!!
