# Humane

## Being logical, rational, scientific while also humane? 

### Albert Schweitzer: "Humanitarianism consists in never sacrificing a human being to a purpose."

### for example
* An unborn child with high chance of mental retardation. Abort?
* A child born with severe disabilities, eg. blind, or deaf, or with permanent mental retardation like Down's Syndrome or Fragile X.
* A newly married couple, one of them soon realizes that the other has severe mental issues. Should he/she stand by their vow and accept lifelong role of caretaker, or divorce?
* A firm realises that a newly hired employee has many medical issues and falls sick often. Terminate the employment?
* All humans become old and senile, some also bankrupt and sick with requirement of costly Medicare. 


#### Is euthanasia denied on humanitarian grounds, or, on rational grounds?  
* Passive Euthanatia "Pulling the Plug"
* Active Euthanatia "a deliberate intervention undertaken with the express intention of ending a life, to relieve intractable suffering"
  * expressed by whom?
  * intractable!!!
